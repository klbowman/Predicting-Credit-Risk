# Predicting Credit Risk

Supervised machine learning models to predict whether a loan from LendingClub will become high risk or not.

## Description

LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub offers their previous data through an API. Data from 2019 & 2020 is used in this repository to create machine learning models (Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier) that classify the risk level of given loans. 

The dashboard includes a drop-down menu that displays the numerical code for each individual sample. When a sample is selected, the “Demographic Info” panel is populated with metadata and the following three charts are populated with data:
* Bar graph displaying the top 10 OTUs by count
* Gauge plot showing the belly button scrubs per week
* Bubble plot displaying OTU counts for the entire sample
